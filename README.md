This code takes in data points written in form of matrix in txt file where each row represent one data point, then it preforms clustering using "Affininty Propagation" methode which has the advantage of not requiring number of clusters (classes), however the best clustering groups are automatically formed depending on points distribution.
The code is implemented in Matlab and is very easy to use as shown in the video
